            <p>1. Realize you dont know everything.</p>
            <p>2. Encourage making mistakes in order to grow.</p>
            <p>3. Properly warm up by starting light and slow.</p>
            <p>4. A light solid form lift is better than a ego based super heavy unstable lift.</p>
            <p>5. Listen to your body.  Don't force something that shouldn't be forced.</p>
            <p>6. When starting something new, start easy and light and grow your strength and skills.</p>
            <p>7. If you are using the same workout repeatedly and its getting stale or your plateauing then vary your routine and do something else.  Don't keep working on something that isn't working in the long term.</p>
            <p>8. Ask for help.  Everyone in the gym was once new.  Don't forget though, some people just suck, but don't let that affect you.</p>
            <p>9. Find a spot where you can maintain consistency.  Consistency is better than going hard then quitting because you cant maintain the pace.  Find that productive spot and use it as much as possible.</p>
            <p>10. Going back to the listening to your body: Take rest days.  Do not repeatedly work the same muscle as the gains will minimize and your chance of injury massively increase.</p>
            <p>11. In relation to staying consistent, keep your workouts under 1 hour.  You dont need to be in the gym for 3 hours to make gains.  If you want to go for 3 hours though thats up to you.</p>
            <p>12. Stay off your phone.  We're not here to work out our thumbs.</p>
            <p>13. Make a playlist that allows you to push yourself and focus for the duration of the workout.</p>
            <p>14. Get your nutrition right and eat enough protein to ensure your work is actually getting integrated to your body.</p>
            <p>15. If using preworkout, learn to cycle off of it when not working out.  Heavy duty long term caffeine use is tied to heart attacks.  If taking a down day, do your best to go without it.</p>
            <p>16. Do not forget your why.  Ultimately people come to the gym for alot of reasons.  Do not forget where you are aiming.  The gym is alot of work but when you put into perspective a life without growth and personal development it is just one facet of a successful life.</p>
            <p>17. Plan over emotion.  If you make a plan, then stick to it and only deviate if you feel that you are going to injure yourself.  You will make it much farther this way.  Your emotions will lead you astray.</p>
            <p>18. Rest is just as important as the workout.  Prioritize solid sleep and proper rest.</p>
            <p>19. No one cares about how you look more than you do.  Just focus on yourself.  Nothing else matters.</p>
            <p>20. Rerack your weights and clean up your area when you are done.</p>
            <p>21. When starting out, bodyweight workouts can be a good place to start.</p>
            <p>22. The biggest muscly, resting b**** face looking dude is usually the chillest dude in the gym.  See what you can take away from someone who is already where you are trying to get to.</p>
            <p>23. Dont worry to much.  Just take everything 1 rep at a time.</p>
            <p>24. Dont stare at people and look wierd. Focus on yourself and your next set.</p>
            <p>25. Stop comparing yourself to others.  All you need to do is be better than yesterday.</p>
            <p>26. Small incremental gains are the name of the game.  Get used to not seeing any massive gain immediately.</p>
            <p>27. Be teachable and open to critiques.  People usually want the best for eachother at the gym.</p>
            <p>28. Try everything.  Do everything once and see what you like.  If you dont like it dont do it.</p>
            <p>29. The gym should be enjoyable.  If you are dreading it then reassess your plans to make it easier to just get started.</p>
            <p>30. Plan your workouts before you go into the gym.  Watch videos and practice the form without weights first.</p>
            <p>31. Work up to doing the "big 3" exercises which are squat, deadlift, and bench press.  These 3 lifts work many different muscles and are the core of many workout plans.</p>
            <p>32. Do what your afraid to do and get used to doing scary stuff.  How are you expected to grow as a person if you're not trying new challenging things?</p>
            <p>33. You have one chance at life.  Why not make the most legendary run of so called life and live to the max?</p>
            <p>34. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is gift. - Master Oogway (Kung Foo Panda) Make the most out of today because tomorrow may not exist.</p>
            <p>35. Your life is your responsibility.  You are the only person that can change you.</p>
            <p>36. On the hard days, aim to be just 1% better.</p>
            <p>37. "It is what is is." - Keep moving. Life isnt fair.  You have to fight.</p>
            <p>38. You will never be as young as you are right now.</p>
            <p>39. Stay healthy because its easier to stay healthy then to get back healthy after falling off.</p>
            <p>40. Stay curious, not judgemental.  - Ted Lasso</p>
            <p>41. Life is an excellent teacher.  Learn the lessons it is teaching.</p>
            <p>42. Second by second you lose the opportunity to become the person you want to be.  Start now.</p>
